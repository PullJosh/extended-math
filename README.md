# extended-math
An extension that extends the mathematical capabilities of Scratch.

## Useage
Head to http://scratchx.org/#scratch and enter `https://rawgit.com/PullJosh/extended-math/master/extendedMath.js` as the extension URL.

## Blocks
### Exponents | ![x ^ y](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PullJosh/extended-math/master/screenshots/exponent.PNG)
Returns x to the power of y.
### Distance | ![distance from x: a y: b to x: c y: d](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PullJosh/extended-math/master/screenshots/distance.PNG)
Gives the distance, in pixels (or `steps`) between two x, y coordinates. Usefull for when there aren't two sprites involved (in which case the `distance to ()` block would be used.)
### Constant | ![constant()](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PullJosh/extended-math/master/screenshots/constant.PNG)
Returns a constant selected from the following list: `pi, e, infinity, golden ratio`
### Factorial | ![factorial of x](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PullJosh/extended-math/master/screenshots/factorial.PNG)
