# extended-math
An extension that extends the mathematical capabilities of Scratch.

## Useage
Head to http://scratchx.org/#scratch and enter `https://rawgit.com/PullJosh/extended-math/master/extendedMath.js` as the extension URL.

## Blocks
### Exponents | `x ^ y`
Returns x to the power of y.
### Distance | `distance from x: a y: b to x: c y: d`
Gives the distance, in pixels (or `steps`) between two x, y coordinates. Usefull for when there aren't two sprites involved (in which case the `distance to ()` block would be used.)
